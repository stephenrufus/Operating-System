# Operating-System
One of the main functions of an operating system is to handle device drivers. Device drivers essentially tell the OS how to interact with any hardware connected to your computer. Without device drivers your computer would not be able to properly connect and interact with your connected hardware.

Another important function of your OS is its user interface or UI. A UI basically manages how a user enters and receives, or displays, information on screen. the most common way a user interacts with the UI is through a graphical user interface, or GUI, which is a more visually appealing way of entering and receiving data.

Another crucial function of an OS is to have System Utilities. These Systems Utilities help provide basic communication with system files. For example, a user needs to use system utilities like copy and paste for file management.
